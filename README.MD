ShoppingLister is a shopping list Application built in Python with the Flask Framework. It is designed to be simple to use and to keep track of all items a user may want to buy.

### Prerequisites
To install this application on your machine. You need to have [Python 3.6](www.python.org) installed on your machine. Then, run

### Future Plans / Recommendations
* add a notification service whereby on the "Remind-me" dates, users are notified of the items they intend to shop.
* include a column to check for whether an item has been bought and therefore tick it off the list
